# Taito-cli website

Implement with Gatsby v2. Layout should probably be something between [reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/) and [gatsbyjs.org](https://gatsbyjs.org/). Use [Taito United](http://taitounited.fi/) brand for appearance. Site content already exists in the docs folder as markdown files.

## Center area of the page

Big title: **Taito**

Subtitle: An extensible toolkit for DevOps and NoOps.

Links/buttons: [Get started](https://github.com/TaitoUnited/taito-cli/tree/dev/docs/manual/README.md) or [see the tutorial](https://github.com/TaitoUnited/taito-cli/tree/dev/docs/tutorial/README.md).

### Standard command set

Use the same simple command set from project to project no matter the technology or infrastructure. Easily manage your containers, functions, databases, object storages, and legacy applications wherever they are deployed. Just add a taito configuration file to your project, and you're good to go. See the [command reference](https://github.com/TaitoUnited/taito-cli/blob/dev/help.txt).

### Extensible

Add taito-cli support for any technology by implementing a taito-cli plugin. Create custom commands and share them with your colleagues as taito-cli extensions. Implement project specific taito-cli commands with npm, make or pipenv.

### All tools included

Working with modern hybrid cloud environments requires lots of tools. Taito-cli Docker container image contains all the tools you need, and you can upgrade it anytime by running `taito --upgrade`. And if you need something special, you can always build your own customized taito-cli container image with Docker.

### Minimal configuration

Use preconfigured templates to set up your infrastructure and to deploy new projects on top of it. Everything works out-of-the-box with minimal configuration.

### Enforce conventions

Enforce good and uniform conventions by providing reusable project templates. Enforce version control conventions with the taito version control commands, and customize your version control workflow, if necessary.
