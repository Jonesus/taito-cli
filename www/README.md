# Taito CLI website

Implement with Gatsby v2. Layout should probably be something between [reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/) and [gatsbyjs.org](https://gatsbyjs.org/). Use [Taito United](http://taitounited.fi/) brand for appearance. Site content already exists in the docs folder as markdown files.

### Standard command set

Use the same simple command set from project to project no matter the technology or infrastructure. Easily manage your containers, functions, databases, object storages, and legacy applications wherever they are deployed. Just add a taito configuration file to your project, and you're good to go. See the [command reference](https://github.com/TaitoUnited/taito-cli/blob/dev/help.txt).

### Extensible

Add Taito CLI support for any technology by implementing a Taito CLI plugin. Create custom commands and share them with your colleagues as Taito CLI extensions. Implement project specific Taito CLI commands with npm, make or pipenv.

Already supported: (AWS), Azure, Google Cloud, (Digital Ocean), Kubernetes, Helm, Docker Compose, (Serverless Framework), PostgreSQL, MySQL, Sqitch, Terraform, (Ansible), and many more!

### All tools included

Working with modern hybrid cloud environments requires lots of tools. Taito CLI Docker container image contains all the tools you need, and you can upgrade it anytime by running `taito --upgrade`. And if you need something special, it is very easy to customize the Taito CLI image with your own requirements.

### No lock-in

Taito CLI is a wrapper that reduces technology and vendor lock-in by providing a standard command set on top of various tools. However, you can use those tools also directly without Taito CLI, and therefore you can stop using Taito CLI at any time, if you like.

### Minimal configuration

Use preconfigured templates to set up your infrastructure and to deploy new projects on top of it. Everything works out-of-the-box with minimal configuration.

### Uniform conventions

Maintain good and uniform conventions by providing reusable project templates. Enforce version control conventions with taito version control commands. Customize your version control workflow, if necessary.
