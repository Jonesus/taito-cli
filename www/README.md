# Taito-cli website

Implement with Gatsby v2. Layout should probably be something between [reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/) and [gatsbyjs.org](https://gatsbyjs.org/). Most of the content already exists in the docs folder as markdown files.

## Center area of the page

Big title: **Taito**

Subtitle: An extensible toolkit for DevOps and NoOps.

Links/buttons: [Get started](https://github.com/TaitoUnited/taito-cli/tree/dev/docs/manual/README.md) or [see the tutorial](https://github.com/TaitoUnited/taito-cli/tree/dev/docs/tutorial/README.md).

## Slogans at the bottom of the page

### Predefined command set

Use the same command set from project to project no matter the technology or infrastructure. For example, run `taito env apply:test` to create a test environment, `taito deployment deploy:test 1.1.0` to deploy version 1.1.0 to it, `taito open logs:prod` to open production logs on browser, `taito db connect` to connect to a local database and `taito db connect:test` to connect to the test environment database. And while you are working on a project, report your working hours with `taito hours add: 6,5 DESCRIPTION` or by using a timer.

### Extensible

Add taito-cli support for any technology by implementing a taito-cli plugin. Create custom commands and share them with your colleagues as taito-cli extensions. Implement project specific taito-cli commands with npm, make or pipenv.

### All tools included

Working with modern hybrid cloud environments requires lots of tools. Taito-cli Docker container image contains all the tools you need, and you can upgrade it anytime by running `taito --upgrade`. And if you need something special, you can always build your own customized taito-cli container image with Docker.

### Minimal configuration

Use preconfigured templates to set up your infrastructure and to deploy new projects on top of it. Everything works out-of-the-box with minimal configuration.
