### TAITO-CLI TROUBLESHOOTING ###
---------------------------------

My application does not work locally
  Try clean start by running 'taito oper-start clean' and then 'taito oper-init'

CI/CD builds fails but everything works locally
  You can debug container builds locally by running `taito ci-build [NAME]`
  e.g. `taito ci-build client`. You can also run any ci/cd step locally
  by using taito-cli.

Authentication error using taito-cli
  If you run into an authentication error during command execution,
  the command probably requires authentication and you either have not
  authenticated or your authentication has expired. In such case, run
  'taito --auth:ENV' to authenticate in the context of currently enabled
  plugins.

Taito-cli says: 'command not found'
  Did you remember to give the correct environment as argument? Commands
  always use local by default, and not all commands support local environment.

  Check your plugin configuration in your taito-config.sh files.

  Make sure that you have set all the environment variables correctly:
