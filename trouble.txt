### TAITO-CLI TROUBLESHOOTING ###
---------------------------------

My application does not work
  Try clean start by running 'taito o-start clean' and then 'taito o-init'

Authentication error using taito-cli
  If you run into an authentication error during command execution,
  the command probably requires authentication and you either have not
  authenticated or your authentication has expired. In such case, run
  'taito b-auth:ENV' to authenticate in the context of currently enabled
  plugins.

Taito-cli says: command not found
  Did you remember to give the correct environment as argument? Commands
  always use local by default, and not all commands support local environment.

  Check your plugin configuration in your taito-config.sh files.

  Make sure that you have set all the environment variables correctly:
