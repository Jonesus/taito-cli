TAITO CLI TROUBLESHOOTING

  Any problem
    - Try to upgrade Taito CLI by running 'taito upgrade'.
    - Run the taito command with the verbose (-v) flag to see the commands that
      plugins run during command execution. If you want to see even more output,
      use the `--debug` flag.

  Read timeout on 'taito kaboom' or 'taito start --clean':
    If the kaboom command fails with Docker Compose read timeout error, stop it
    with ctrl+c, start it again with 'taito start', and then run 'taito init'.
    For more info, see https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/3927

  Application hangs on 'taito kaboom' or 'taito start':
    There is probably something wrong with your docker. You can try some of the
    following alternatives:
    - Restart docker daemon
    - Clean up docker with 'taito workspace clean'
    - Reset docker to factory defaults
      (on macOS: preferences -> reset -> reset to factory defaults)

  Taito CLI hangs after displaying the copyright notice
    First try restarting your Docker daemon. If the problem persists after
    Docker restart, try Docker reset as your Docker virtual disk might have
    been corrupted. Rebooting your computer might also help.

  Strange Docker problems
    Try to reset docker to factory defaults (on macOS: preferences -> reset) or
    just clean it by running 'taito workspace clean'. Adjust your Docker
    resource limits (on macOS: preferences -> disk, preferences -> advanced).

  'No configuration has been provided'
    The command probably requires authentication and you either have not
    authenticated or your authentication has expired. In such case, run
    'taito auth:ENV' or 'taito auth:ENV reset' to authenticate.

  Connection or authorization error
    If you run into a connection or authorization error during Taito CLI
    command execution, the command probably requires authentication and you
    either have not authenticated or your authentication has expired. In such
    case, run 'taito auth:ENV' or 'taito auth:ENV reset' to authenticate.

  'No space left on device'
    Try cleaning your local workspace by running 'taito workspace clean'. You
    can also try to enlarge the docker virtual disk in your docker preferences.
    Also check that you have free disk space available on your computer.

  'Error: UPGRADE FAILED: "my-project-ENV" has no deployed releases'
    Helm release is probably corrupted. Try to fix it by running
    'taito stop:ENV' or 'taito down:ENV'.

  502 Bad Gateway
    Check application status with `taito status:ENV` and
    `taito logs:CONTAINER:ENV` commands, and fix the problem. If everything
    seems fine, check ingress logs. Perhaps you have not set basic auth secrets
    required by ingress.

  Invalid SSL certificate (NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID)
    Check ingress logs. Perhaps SSL certificate processing has failed for some
    reason.

  Some library directories are owned by root (e.g. node_modules)
    You probably have run `taito start` before installing libraries with
    'taito env apply', and library directory Docker mounts have failed because
    of a missing directory. This problem seems to occur only on Linux.
    Delete the directories using sudo and try again in the correct order:
    'taito env apply', 'taito start'.

  'Unknown command'
    - Did you execute the command in a project directory that contains
      taito-config.sh?
    - Did you give the correct environment as argument? Commands always use the
      local environment by default.
    - Check your plugin configuration in your taito-config.sh files. Perhaps
      some plugins are not enabled.
    - Make sure that you have set all the environment variables correctly:
      TODO...
    - Try upgrading Taito CLI with 'taito upgrade'
    - Try upgrading Docker and Docker Compose

  My application continuously crashes or restarts
    Liveness probe is probably failing. Check logs with `taito logs:TARGET:ENV`
    or `taito open logs:ENV`. If you cannot figure out a reason, try to kill
    the container with `taito kill:TARGET:ENV` to see if it helps.

  Application does not work locally
    - Try clean start by running 'taito kaboom'. If the kaboom command fails
      with Docker Compose read timeout error, stop it with ctrl+c, start it
      again with 'taito start', and then run 'taito init'
    - Try cleaning your local workspace by running 'workspace-kill' and
      'workspace-clean'

  CI/CD build fails but everything works locally
    See build logs by running 'taito open builds' and fix the problem. If there
    is no apparent reason why the build failed, just try to retry the CI/CD
    build. If it fails again, try to build production build locally by running
    'taito start --clean --prod' and then try to fix the build problem.

  'Error: UPGRADE FAILED: "..." has no deployed releases'
    Helm release has been corrupted somehow. Try deleting Helm release with
    'taito down:ENV', wait for a while, and then deploy the Helm release with
    'taito deployment deploy:ENV' or 'taito deployment start:ENV'.
