TAITO-CLI TROUBLESHOOTING

  'command not found'
    Try running 'taito --upgrade'

    Did you give the correct environment as argument? Commands always use the
    local environment by default.

    Check your plugin configuration in your taito-config.sh files.

    Make sure that you have set all the environment variables correctly:
    TODO...

  My application does not work locally
    Try clean install, start and init by running:

    $ taito install --clean
    $ taito start --clean
    $ taito init --clean

  CI/CD build fails but everything works locally
    See build logs by running 'taito open builds' and fix the problem. If there
    is no apparent reason why the build failed, just try to retry the CI/CD
    build. If it fails again, try to build production build locally by running
    'taito start --clean --prod' and then try to fix the build problem.

  Connection or authorization error using taito-cli
    If you run into an connection or authorization error during command
    execution, the command probably requires authentication and you either have
    not authenticated or your authentication has expired. In such case, run
    'taito --auth:ENV' to authenticate.
