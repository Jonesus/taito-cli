TAITO-CLI TROUBLESHOOTING

  'No space left on device'
    Try cleaning your local workspace by running 'workspace clean'. You can
    also try to enlarge the docker virtual disk in your docker preferences.

  Taito-cli hangs after displaying the copyright notice
    First try restarting your Docker daemon. If the problem persists after
    Docker restart, try Docker reset as your Docker virtual disk might have
    been corrupted.

  Connection or authorization error
    If you run into an connection or authorization error during taito-cli
    command execution, the command probably requires authentication and you
    either have not authenticated or your authentication has expired. In such
    case, run 'taito --auth:ENV' to authenticate.

  'command not found'
    * Try running 'taito --upgrade'
    * Try upgrading docker and docker-compose
    * Did you give the correct environment as argument? Commands always use the
      local environment by default.
    * Check your plugin configuration in your taito-config.sh files.
    * Make sure that you have set all the environment variables correctly:
      TODO...

  Application does not work locally
    * Try clean start by running:
      $ taito install --clean
      $ taito start --clean
      $ taito init --clean
    * Try cleaning your local workspace by running 'workspace-clean' and/or
      'workspace-kill'

  CI/CD build fails but everything works locally
    See build logs by running 'taito open builds' and fix the problem. If there
    is no apparent reason why the build failed, just try to retry the CI/CD
    build. If it fails again, try to build production build locally by running
    'taito start --clean --prod' and then try to fix the build problem.

  'Not building a new image because ci_exec_build is false.'
    The ci_exec_build taito config setting is set to false for the environment
    in question. Therefore a new image will not ever be built for the
    environment. An existing image will be used instead.
