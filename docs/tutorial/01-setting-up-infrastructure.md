## 1. Setting up infrastructure

### 1.1. Install or upgrade taito-cli

See the [installation instructions](https://github.com/TaitoUnited/taito-cli/blob/dev/docs/manual/02-installation.md) of the taito-cli manual. If you have already installed taito-cli, you can upgrade it with `taito --upgrade`.

### 1.2. Set up cloud environment, Kubernetes, database cluster and CI/CD pipeline

Taito-cli is designed to be infrastructure agnostic. That is, the same taito-cli commands can be used in any project no matter the technology or infrastructure. These exercises, however, are based on [kubernetes-template](https://github.com/TaitoUnited/server-template) that requires Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, S3 compatible storage bucket, and a CI/CD pipeline that is supported by the project template. If you don't have an existing infrastructure that provides these already, you can easily set them up by creating a new **taito zone** based on one of the [infrastructure templates](https://github.com/TaitoUnited/taito-cli/blob/dev/docs/templates.md#infrastructure-templates):

> WARNING: Not tested yet.

1. Create a user account to one of the cloud service platforms. For now, you should choose Google Cloud because taito-cli support for other cloud providers is still work-in-progress. As a new Google Cloud user you get â‚¬300 worth of cloud services for free, so trying will cost you nothing. Go to [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com) and log in with your Google user account.

2. Register a domain name, and get a DNS service for configuring IP addresses for the domain. If you don't have these already, you can buy an affordable domain name from [namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/). Namecheap provides also [DNS](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/freedns/), but since you already have a Google Cloud account, you can also use the [Google Cloud DNS](https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/) with your domain name.

3. Create a taito zone based on the Google Cloud example with the following commands. Replace `EDIT` with your favorite editor.

    ```shell
    cp -r taito-cli/examples/zones/gcloud my-zone
    cd my-zone
    EDIT taito-config.sh
    taito zone apply
    ```

A **taito zone** provides infrastructure that your projects are deployed on. The Google Cloud example creates you Kubernetes and PostgreSQL clusters among other things.

You usually have at least two **taito zones**: one for development and testing purposes, and an another one for production usage. In these exercises, however, you require only one **taito zone**.

Do not confuse taito zones with cloud provider regions and zones. One **taito zone** may use multiple cloud provider regions and zones to achieve high availability and regional resiliency.
