OPTIONS

  --help, -h
    Show help.txt of current project and a list of all taito-cli commands.
    Run 'taito COMMAND -h' to get help for a specific command or
    'taito PREFIX -h' to get help for a specific set of commands.

  --search, -s
    Same as '--help' but executes a wider search by including also command
    descriptions in search.
    TODO implement

  --trouble
    Show trouble.txt of current project and taito-cli.

  --readme
    Show README.md of current project and taito-cli.

  --upgrade
    Upgrade taito-cli and its extensions to the latest version.

  --upgrade-deps
    Upgrade tools bundled inside the current taito-cli docker container to the
    latest version. This option can be useful if you need to use an old version
    of taito-cli container image, but require tools to be upgraded.
    TODO implement

  --auth:ENV
    Authenticate in the context of the given environment.

  --dev, -d
    Run in development mode. In the development mode your local taito-cli
    directory is mounted on the container.
    TODO always pass on -d switch when running another taito command

  --
    Execute any command inside the taito-cli container. Example:
    taito -- kubectl get pods

  --shell
    Start interactive shell on the taito-cli container.

  --admin, -a
    Execute as admin.

  --project PROJECT, -p PROJECT
    Execute command in the context of given project. This command allows
    you to execute a taito-cli command without cloning the project repository

    Prints all project commands. You can use this to implement autocompletion
    for taito-cli commands.

  -c
    Informs taito-cli that the command is continuing from a previous command
    execution and therefore the copyright license should not be shown again.

  -z
    Skip taito command overrides.

ARGUMENTS

  ENV
    Environment: 'local', 'feature', 'dev', 'test', 'staging' or 'prod'.
    Environment is 'local' by default. For mobile projects ENV can also be
    'ios' or 'android'.

  POD
    Depending on the environment, POD may reference to a Kubernetes pod,
    a Docker container, a function or some other deployable module.

ALTERNATIVE HYPHEN SYNTAX

  You can also use hyphen instead of space e.g. `taito db-open:dev`

PROJECT: BASIC OPERATIONS

  > All basic operation commands use 'oper' as a command grouping prefix but
  > you can leave it out if you like.

  install [--clean] [--all]
    Install everything that needs to installed locally on host (e.g. libraries
    for linting and autocompletion purposes). Use the '--clean' flag to execute
    a clean install. Use the '--all' flag to request for a full install in case
    you need all libraries to be installed on host for autocompletion, etc.
    TIP: Enable the 'make', 'npm' or 'pipenv' plugin.

  env
    Initialize the development environment. This command is for non-dockerized
    projects that require project specific environment variables to be set.
    For example the 'pipenv' plugin uses this command to initialize the python
    virtualenv.

  build
    Builds a project. This command is for non-dockerized projects that need to
    be compiled or built before application can be started.
    TIP: Enable the 'make' plugin and implement the script in your makefile.

  start[:ENV] [--background] [--clean] [--prod] [POD] [-- ARGS]
    Starts the defined environment e.g 'taito start' or 'taito start:dev'.
    Optional arguments for local environment:
    .
    --backgroud: Run in background.
    --clean: Clean everything before start.
    --prod: Run production build instead of development build.
    POD: Start only the given pod/container/function/module/program
    -- ARGS: Additional arguments

  run:ENV [--no-deps] [-d,--device] [POD] [-- ARGS]
    Runs the application in the defined environment e.g 'taito run:ios'.
    Optional arguments for running in local environment:
    .
    -d,--device: Run on a real device instead of emulator.
    --no-deps: TODO Do not run dependencies (e.g linked services)
    POD: Run only the given pod/container/function/module/program
    -- ARGS: Additional arguments

  init[:ENV] [--clean]
    Make sure that everything has been initialized after start (database, etc.).
    Use the '--clean' flag to delete all existing data before init.

  stop[:ENV]
    Stop. Stops the application in the defined environment e.g 'taito stop'
    or 'taito stop:dev'.

  info[:ENV]
    Show some useful information about the environment (e.g. shared user
    accounts that you can use to log in).
    TIP: Enable the 'make' or 'npm' plugin and implement info[:ENV] script
    in your makefile/package.json.

  unit [CONTAINER]
    Run unit tests.
    TIP: Enable the 'make' or 'npm' plugin and implement unit script in your
    makefile/package.json.

  test[:ENV] [CONTAINER] [SUITE]
    Run integration and end-to-end tests.
    TIP: Enable the 'make' or 'npm' plugin and implement test scripts in your
    makefile/package.json using the `taito `. You can configure test users and
    passwords for each environment in taito-config.sh as those settings are
    available to your script as environment variables. At least implement tests
    for dev environment.

  analyze
    Analyzes implementation and gives you feedback accordingly (webpack
    bundle analysis, code quality analysis, vulnerability analysis, etc.)
    TIP: Enable the 'make' or 'npm' plugin and implement analyze script
    in your makefile/package.json

  scan
    Lint code, scan for vulnerabilities, etc.
    TIP: Enable the 'make' or 'npm' plugin and implement scan script in your
    makefile/package.json.

  lint
    Lint code
    TIP: Enable the 'make' or 'npm' plugin and implement lint script in your
    makefile/package.json.

  docs
    Generate docs e.g. API docs from API definitions and PDF files from
    markdown documentation.
    TIP: Enable the 'make' or 'npm' plugin and implement docs script in your
    makefile/package.json.

  exec[:ENV] POD CONTAINER COMMAND
    Execute command in pod. Give -- as container if it should be determined
    automatically by POD name.
    Examples:
    $ taito exec: client -- echo "taito!"

GLOBAL: WORKSPACE OPERATIONS

  workspace clean
    Clean your workspace e.g. by deleting all docker container images and
    volumes that you haven't used for a while.

  workspace kill
    Kill all running processes (e.g. kill all docker processes to free reserved
    ports).

PROJECT: VERSION CONTROL OPERATIONS

  vc env list
    List all environment branches.

  vc env: BRANCH [SOURCE_BRANCH]
    Creates a new environment branch or executes a normal branch checkout if
    the branch already exists. The dev branch is used as a default source
    branch.

  vc env merge [SOURCE_BRANCH] [DESTINATION_BRANCH]
    Merges source env branch to target env branch without making changes
    to the current local git workspace. Current branch is used as a default
    source branch. The command fails if fast-forward is not possible. Merge
    operations between environment branches should always be fast-forwarded so
    that a container is first built for dev environment and then the same
    container is deployed to other environments as well once environment
    branches are merged.

  vc feat list
    List all feature branches.

  vc feat:[ENV] FEATURE_NAME
    Creates a new branch for a feature or executes a normal branch checkout if
    the branch already exists. The dev branch is used as a default env branch
    (source branch).

  vc feat rebase[:ENV] [FEATURE_NAME]
    Rebases a feature branch. The dev branch is used as a default env branch
    that the feature branch is rebased with.

  vc feat squash[:ENV] [FEATURE_NAME]
    Merges a feature to a target branch as a single squashed commit and
    deletes the feature branch. The dev branch is used as a default env
    branch (destination for merge). Use this command for a short-lived feature
    branch with a cohesive set of changes.

  vc feat merge[:ENV] [FEATURE_NAME]
    Merges a feature to a target branch. The dev branch is used as a
    default env branch (destination for merge). The command suggests rebase
    before merge and delete feature after merge. With rebase you can clean up
    commit history before merge e.g. by reordering commits and selectively
    squashing some of them together.

  vc feat pr[:ENV] [FEATURE_NAME]
    Creates a pull request for a feature. The dev branch is used as a default
    env branch (destination for merge). The command suggests rebase before
    making the pull request. With rebase you can clean up commit history by
    reordering commits and selectively squashing some of them together.

PROJECT: DATABASE OPERATIONS

  db add: NAME [-r REQUIRES] [-n DESCRIPTION]
    Add a new change to migration plan. Run 'db add' without arguments to get
    help. You can run the change to local database by running `taito db:deploy`.
    Example: 'taito db add order.table -r user.table -n 'Table for orders.'

  db proxy[:ENV]
    Starts a proxy for accessing a database and shows connections details that
    you should use with your database GUI tool to connect the database. If
    proxy is not required, the command shows connection details nevertheless.
    If you don't have a personal account for the database, you can get a
    working username and password by running `taito oper secrets:ENV`. Note that
    passwords are rotated once in a while, thus, if you get an authentication
    error, retrieve new secrets by running `taito oper secrets:ENV` again.

  db open[:ENV] [USERNAME]
    Access database from command line. DB proxy connection and secrets are
    handled automatically. NOTE: If you want to access database using a GUI
    tool, use the db proxy:ENV command instead.

  db dump[:ENV] FILE
    Take a database dump. DB proxy connection and secrets are handled
    automatically.

  db import:[ENV] FILE
    Import a file to database. DB proxy connection and secrets are
    handled automatically. Always give file path relative to the project root.
    Example: taito db import:dev ./database/my-file.sql

  db deploy[:ENV]
    Deploy changes to database. DB proxy connection and secrets are handled
    automatically.

  db diff:[ENV] [OTHER_ENV]
    Compare database schemas of two environments. DB proxy connection and
    secrets are handled automatically. TODO implement.

  db log[:ENV]
    View change log of database. DB proxy connection and secrets are handled
    automatically.

  db rebase:[ENV] [CHANGE]
    Rebases database by running 'db revert' and then 'db deploy'. DB proxy
    connection and secrets are handled automatically. The command reverts all
    changes by default. If you would like to revert to a specific revision
    instead, view the change log first with `taito db log[:ENV]` and then run
    `taito db revert[:ENV] CHANGE`.

  db revert:[ENV] [CHANGE]
    Revert database changes. DB proxy connection and secrets are
    handled automatically. Revert the previous migration batch by running
    `taito db revert[:ENV]`. If you would like to revert to a specific revision
    instead, view the change log first with `taito db log[:ENV]` and then run
    `taito db revert[:ENV] CHANGE`. TODO currently always requires CHANGE
    param.

  db recreate[:ENV]
    Recreates the database. Thus on next deployment, all database migrations
    will be run from the beginning. DB proxy connection and secrets are handled
    automatically.

  db copy:ENV SOURCE_ENV
    Copy database from one environment to another. For example
    `db copy:staging prod` or `db copy:local dev`. If you do not have enough
    rights, ask devops personnel to do this for you. DB proxy connection and
    secrets are handled automatically.

  db copyquick:ENV SOURCE_ENV
    Copy database quickly from one environent to another. DB proxy connection
    and secrets are handled automatically. NOTE: The command requires
    that both databases are located on the same database cluster. The command
    might also do some quirky things to make copying quicker so it might not
    be safe to use it with a live production database.

PROJECT: MANUAL DEPLOYMENT OPERATIONS

  deployment build:[ENV] NAME
    Build, push and deploy a container or some other deployable module to
    server. Use this when you need to quickly deploy manual changes to some
    environment. Example: taito deployment build:dev server

  deployment deploy:ENV TAG|COMMIT
    Deploys a prebuilt version to an environment. TODO implement

  deployment cancel:ENV [IGNORE_BUILD_ID]
    Cancel an ongoing build, but ignore the given build id.

  deployment revision[:ENV]
    Show current revision.

  deployment revert[:ENV] [REVISION]
    Reverts application to another revision. Reverts to the previous version
    if revision has not been given as argument. You can see current revision
    number by running `taito deployment revision[:ENV]`.

PROJECT: AUTOMATIC CI/CD OPERATIONS

  ci prepare
    Set ci flags by status check. The ci flags are used to control the following
    ci steps. For example if taitoflag_images_exist is set, many of the ci steps
    will be skipped since all images have already been built and tested
    by some previous CI build.

  ci build:[ENV] CONTAINER_NAME IMAGE_TAG [PROJECT_REPOSITORY]
    Builds image. Example: 'taito ci build:dev client test1'.

  ci push: CONTAINER_NAME IMAGE_TAG [PROJECT_REPOSITORY]
    Pushes image to image registry. Example: 'taito ci push:dev client test1'.

  ci deploy[:ENV] [IMAGE_TAG] [--dry-run]
    Deploy the application either by using IMAGE_TAG given as parameter or
    using the latest image found for the environment in question. Use dry-run
    switch to execute a dry run. Example: 'taito ci deploy:dev test1'.
    NOTE: Does not deploy database changes (TIP: 'taito db deploy[:ENV]')

  ci wait[:ENV]
    Waits until application has been succesfully deployed to server.
    For example polls the app url until version number changes to something
    else. This is used by CI/CD scripts to wait deployment before running the
    api and e2e tests.

  ci verify[:ENV]
    Verifies that everything went ok e.g. by checking test results. If something
    went wrong and autorevert is enabled for the environment, runs
    `taito db revert[:ENV]` and `taito deployment revert[:ENV]`.

  ci publish
    Publishes build artifacts (e.g. docs, test reports) to a central location.

  ci release pre:ENV
  ci release post:ENV
    Release pre and post handling. These commands usually generate release notes
    automatically and tag the git repository with a new version number.
    TIP: Enable the 'make' or 'npm' plugin and implement release-pre:prod and
    release-post:prod scripts in your makefile/package.json.

    Destroy a zone.

GLOBAL: PASSWORDS

  passwd share
    Sets a one-time shared password that can be read only once using a
    magic link and will be removed automatically after a while if it has not
