## 18. Serverless on Kubernetes: Knative

Currently there are about 10 competing serverless frameworks built on top of Kubernetes. Knative seems to be the most promising one since it is backed up by a bunch of big companies and Google Cloud will provide it as an add-on for Google Kubernetes Engine (currently available with an early access request).

Knative uses Istio under the hood. Ambassador API gateway combined with Knative and Istio might also be a good option.
