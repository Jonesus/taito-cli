# Quickstart

In this example we use Google Cloud and Sentry.

> NOTE: Taito-cli is still work in progress. Not all steps work yet.

## Initial preparations

1. Create a Google Cloud account, if you don't have one already.

2. Create a Sentry account, if you don't have one already.

3. Install taito-cli.

## Create a taito zone

1. Configure `taito_zone` and `gcloud_organization` settings in the `zone/taito-config.sh` file.

2. Create a zone by running `taito zone install` in the zone directory.

## Create a project and deploy it to taito-zone

1. Create a new project by running `taito template create server-template`.

2. Configure the following settings in the `taito-config.sh` file of the project:

    * TODO...

3. Run `taito project config` in the project directory. This will create a new Sentry project for you.

4. Create dev and prod environments for the project by running `taito env create:dev` and `taito env create:prod` in the project directory. This will TODO:

5. Start local development by running: `taito install`, `taito start`, `taito init` and `taito open app`.

6. Push a change in the dev branch and it will be deployed on your Kubernetes cluster running on Google Cloud as a development version. You can open it on browser by running `taito open app:dev`.

7. Merge the change in the master branch and it will be deployed on your Kubernetes cluster running on Google Cloud as a production version. You can open it on browser by running `taito open app:prod`.

Hooray! You are now running your app in production with all the bells and whistles like multiple environments, automatic deployments, deployment versioning and reversions, data migrations, autogenerated release notes, autogenerated ssl certificates, secret rotation, error tracking, uptime monitoring, log analytics, backups, autoscaling, and high availability. Nevertheless, almost anyone is able to operate it using the easy-to-use command set provided by the `taito-cli`. You can also easily move it to any cloud service provider, or alternatively host it on your own dedicated servers. And all the same taito-cli commands still work as they should.

## Running on some other infrastructure

Want to run software on some other infrastructure than Google Cloud and Kubernetes? Please contribute by developing taito-cli plugins for the infrastructure in question.

## Create an custom extension

## Miscellaneous tips

See taito-cli commands by running `taito -h`.
